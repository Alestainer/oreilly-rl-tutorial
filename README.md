# Deep Reinforcement Learning Tutorial

Contains Jupyter notebooks associated with the [*Deep Reinforcement Learning Tutorial*](https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/detail/59390) given at the O'Reilly 2017 NYC AI Conference. Slides from the presentation can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxZSPcA0DrkfNG9aSjYxM1RMVzQ).

Required Unity Environments can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxZSPcA0DrkfQ2pPWkRFQkNiTnc?usp=sharing). Download and unzip the .zip file associated with your OS (ie Linux, Mac, or Windows) and move each of the files within the unzipped folder (ie 2DBall, 3DBall, etc) to the root directory of this repository.

All notebooks and environments tested with Python2 and Python3 on macOS Sierra.

## Requirements
* Tensorflow (version 1.0+)
* Pillow
* Matplotlib
* numpy
* scipy
* Jupyter

To install dependencies, run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

or 

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If your Python environment doesn't include `pip`, see these [instructions](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-linux-tools/#installing-pip-setuptools-wheel-with-linux-package-managers) on installing it.

## Training RL Agents

To launch jupyter, run:

`jupyter notebook` 

Then navigate to `localhost:8888` to access each training notebook.

To monitor training progress, run the following from the root directory of this repo:

`tensorboard --logdir='./summaries'`

Then navigate to `localhost:6006` to monitor progress with Tensorboard.
